# NLP Lyrics Generator
This is a style-specific hip-hop lyrics generator based on the Transformer model that I worked on with Shuhe Wang. It includes my project report, code and data. Please read the report for more details.

If you want to run the code, please read the following:
To run the lyrics_scrapper, you can run the following command line:
python lyrics_scraper.py --verbose --lyrics_dir='my_lyrics_folder' â€”songs_per_artists=10

To run the code of lyrics generator, you need to first upload the data and call it in the training process.
The code will first train the model by the uploaded dataset, and then you can randomly change the prompt to let the model generate the following lines.
Also, you can try to run the cells in the post-trained filter section to edit the endings of the generated lyrics.

In the evaluation code, since the trained models are too large, you need to save the trained models from the lyrics generator code and then upload them in the calculation of perplexity.
In the calculation of rhyme density, you can put the piece of lyrics you want to evaluate to the rhyme() function.
